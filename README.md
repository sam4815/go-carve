# go-carve
Resize images using seam carving. [Try it out!](https://sam4815.github.io/go-carve)

## About

This project was intended to explore and understand in greater detail [seam carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving), a really interesting algorithm used to resize images. It functions by calculating the least important pixel paths across an image and deleting them. I was also interested in trying out WebAssembly with Go.
